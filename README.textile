The package is composed of two plugin to measure      conformance and performance metrics.</p>    <p>Both plugin replayed a log events on the bussiness process model. The      model is a Petri net and reproduces a bussiness process. <br>    </p>    <p> The result of Conformance plugin is a set Petri nets with annoted for      all place remaining, missing token and transition force enabled for all      trace of log. <br>    </p>    <p>The result of performance plugin is a set Petri nets with annoted for all      place sojourn, wait and synchronization time for all trace log and all      Petri net place, and annoted them on the Petri net. </p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p>The user guide for this plugin is <a href="https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Documentation/">here</a>&nbsp;https://svn.win.tue.nl/repos/prom/Documentation/PetriNetReplayAnalysis.pdf</p>    <p>The source code for this plugin is <a href="https://github.com/rupos-it/PetriNetReplayAnalysis">here</a>      https://github.com/rupos-it/PetriNetReplayAnalysis&nbsp;</p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p><span style="font-size:12px;"><sup>1</sup>Roberto Bruni, Andrea        Corradini, Gianluigi Ferrari, Tito Flagella, Roberto Guanciale, and        Giorgio O.
